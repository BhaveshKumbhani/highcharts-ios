# Version 6.1.0

## Framework:

1. Added feature for loading data directly from a CSV URL or JSON resource, and keeping it dynamically updated through the data.enablePolling option.
2. Added examples of themes with styled mode: dark-unica, sand-signika, grid-light.
3. Added feature to animate the series when updating data through Series.setData, Series.update or Chart.update. The new logic looks for matching X values and can be disabled through setData's updatePoints option.
4. Added Open in Cloud functionality in the export-data module.
5. Added pattern fill module.
6. Added new feature, chart.scrollablePlotArea, to provide smooth scrolling of data on small devices.
7. Added animation parameter to Chart.update.
8. Added default max-width for pie data labels to avoid long labels squeezing the pie itself.
9. Added new option, data.beforeParse, to allow modifying the CSV when using the data.csvURL option.
10. Added new option, legend.alignColumns, providing better default layout for multiline horizontal legends.
11. Added support for Infinity and -Infinity values for plotOptions.area.threshold, to make the area extend towards either Y axis extreme. Closes #8139.
12. Added support for nested series.keys.
13. Added options minFontSize and maxFontSize to Wordcloud.
